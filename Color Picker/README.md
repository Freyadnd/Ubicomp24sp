## Circuit Playground Color Picker Palette Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to creating a color picker palette using the Circuit Playground. This device is designed to recognize and display colors from real-world objects, assisting artists and designers in capturing and using these colors in their work.

### Overview

The Circuit Playground Color Picker Palette allows users to capture color data from physical objects and display it on the built-in RGB LEDs. This tool is particularly useful for artists, designers, or anyone needing to match or record specific colors for digital use or educational purposes.

### Components Needed

- **Adafruit Circuit Playground**: Either the Classic or Express model.
- **USB Cable**: To connect the Circuit Playground to your computer for programming and power.
- **External Battery Pack**: For portable use.
- **Optional**: Additional NeoPixel LEDs for extended display.

### Setup and Installation

#### Hardware Setup

1. **Connect the Circuit Playground to your computer** using the USB cable. Ensure that the switch on the board is set to "ON".
2. **If using an external battery pack**, connect it to the Circuit Playground to test the setup's portability.

#### Software Setup

1. **Install Arduino IDE**: Download and install the Arduino IDE from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. **Install Adafruit Libraries**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries**.
   - Search for and install **Adafruit Circuit Playground** library.

### Programming

#### Color Sensing Code

```cpp
#include <Adafruit_CircuitPlayground.h>

void setup() {
  CircuitPlayground.begin();
}

void loop() {
  // Read color from the onboard color sensor
  uint32_t color = CircuitPlayground.readColor();

  // Display the color on the built-in LEDs
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(i, color);
  }

  delay(1000);  // Update every second
}
```

This basic program initializes the Circuit Playground and continuously reads the color detected by its onboard sensor, displaying this color across its LED ring.

### Usage Instructions

1. **Power on the Circuit Playground** via USB or an external battery pack.
2. **Place the device close to the object** whose color you want to detect. The color sensor is located near the center of the board.
3. **Observe the LED ring**; it should light up with the color detected by the sensor.
4. **Record the color** if needed, or use the displayed color as a reference for your projects.

### Safety and Maintenance

- Keep the device dry and avoid exposing it to high temperatures.
- When not in use, disconnect the power source to conserve battery life.
- Handle the Circuit Playground with care to avoid damaging the sensors and components.

### Troubleshooting

- **LEDs do not light up**: Ensure that the board is properly powered and the script is correctly uploaded.
- **Inaccurate color detection**: Verify that the sensor is not obstructed and that there is sufficient lighting.

### Conclusion

The Circuit Playground Color Picker Palette is a versatile tool that enhances the creative capabilities of anyone working with color. By following these instructions, users can effectively integrate real-world colors into their digital or artistic workflows.
